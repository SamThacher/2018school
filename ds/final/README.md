Here are the 2 games I used:

https://github.com/imwithye/Hangman-in-Python

https://repl.it/@samaugust/Ruby-IRB-Poker-Game


Hangman: The only package you need to run this game locally is aiml. So here are the steps to run:
pip install aiml
python3 hangman.py

That should be it.

For Ruby poker: This game requires the user to have ruby and the default packages that come along with it. Then you just have to install wit using the gem installer. steps:
gem install wit
ruby pokerreplit.rb

I have attached text files of the diffs so you can see what I changed as well.
